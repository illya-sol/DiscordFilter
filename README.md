# Discord Filter

using boilerplate for Puppeteer + TypeScript.

I just wanted to use TypeScript, instead of JavaScript, to crawl websites with Puppeteer.  
I didn't want to be bothered like 'I need to install puppeteer first, then node-ts, oh I forgot to install tslint...'.  
You neither, right ?

Just clone this repo.

## Usage
1. Install Yarn or Npm
2. Then execute this:

```
git clone https://github.com/illya-sol/DiscordFilter.git
cd DiscordFilter
yarn install
```

2. Write your code in `src/index.ts`
3. `yarn start`
